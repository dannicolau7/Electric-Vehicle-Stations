Notes:,,,,,,,,,,
"Starting in 2007, data snapshots were taken each year in December as close to the end of the year as possible. Before 2007, data snapshots were based on the federal fiscal year and taken in September as close as possible to the end of the month.",,,,,,,,,,
* Stations selling low-level biodiesel blends (less than B20) are included in the station counts between 2005 and 2007.,,,,,,,,,,
"** Between 2011 and 2013, the electric vehicle charging counts are an estimate of the number of geographic locations (i.e., station locations) based on the number of EV charging ports because station counts were not captured in these years. See 
U.S. Public and Private Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (afdc.energy.gov/data/10964) for counts of both EV charging ports and station locations.",,,,,,,,,,
*** Total is the total number of fuel types sold at stations. Stations are counted once for each type of fuel sold.,,,,,,,,,,
